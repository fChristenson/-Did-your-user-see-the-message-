# Did your user see the message?

## What we will cover

* Temporary messages
* The issues with three common ways to know if a user has seen a message
* Intersection observers and how they can help us

## Notes

This is a feature that is upcoming in the browser that I believe will make a BIG
difference in the way we work.

Not only can we use it for this use case but it is perfect for lazy loading content.
